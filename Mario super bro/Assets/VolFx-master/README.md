VolFx is a customizable multi post-processing with buffer system for Unity Urp<br>
that allows building a custom scene processing architecture for visual effects creation âœ¨

Tested with 2022.2, 2023.2 Web

## Features
* Custom passes - expandable, has minimal set of custom effects and generic blit feature
* Targeting post processing - can be applyed to scene objects by layer mask
* Volume controll - all build in effects controlled via volume profile and linked to a layer mask, so scene processing can be easily made dynamic
* Buffer system - can render object to a buffer texture to provide additional textures(like light maps, pattern animations, height etc) then process and use them later throug a shader
* Configurable pipeline - each effect can be reordered and configurade depending on the application
* Part of Artwork project - all effects from [PostArt](https://github.com/NullTale/PixelationFx) projects can be added as passes to VolFx without cluttering Volume or RenderFeature's list

Visual novel example, post processing applyed to scene objects by LayerMask to blur the background and fade character sprite<br>
Thus you can make the appearance effect or apply graphical changes separately to scene objects <br>

There is an example of light texture post processing generated by [GiLight2D](https://github.com/NullTale/GiLight2D)<br>
Volume control allows to tweack texture at runtime to achive desiared light visualization<br>

Can have may instances, order of post effects can be configured as their options<br>

## Install and usage
Install via Unity [PackageManager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html) <br>
```
https://github.com/NullTale/VolFx.git
```

Add `VolFx` feature to UrpRenderer add post-process passes to it, control via volume profile <br>

![_Urp](https://github.com/NullTale/VolFx/assets/1497430/21dda2ff-c82e-4d46-8335-d542fc53428c) <br>
<sup>* optionally configure the render event, source with output and volume mask</sup>

`VolBuffers` feature can be used to collect specific object to a texture to provide some vfx texture source<br>
that can be post processed at runtime and used later throug a shader

## Build in Effects

VolFx was built to be highly configurable and most of the effects are powerful in their [combination](https://twitter.com/NullTale/status/1693158627442364490) <br>
There can be a number of custom `Blit` passes controlled via material for easy effect implementation(permanent effects).

#### Extended Color Adjustments
With the curve you can adjust the range on which part of the image to apply Color Adjustement <br>
Other option are classic exept the alpha channel that used to adjust alpha chennel to blend images properly <br>

![Adjustments](https://github.com/NullTale/VolFx/assets/1497430/af84b49d-22c3-47fd-a315-d4e8f7b35ac9)

#### Extended Bloom
Threshold controlled by curve, color made with gradient(support blending) <br>
Also has some advanved options in effect pass like flickering, samples count and scuttering curve. <br>
Basically extended remplementation of moust popular effect to process the images <br>

![Bloom](https://github.com/NullTale/VolFx/assets/1497430/12475cb3-ab40-4e89-a3ac-6730155ed075)

#### Blur
Just simple Blur with radial and distortion options

![Blur](https://github.com/NullTale/VolFx/assets/1497430/28b6a7ab-1eae-4053-8088-99a20cc9a6b3)

#### GradientMap
Colorization effect taken from pupular graphic editors [GradientMap](https://www.bcit.cc/cms/lib04/NJ03000372/Centricity/Domain/299/p6_howto_use_gradient_maps%2018.pdf) <br>
Very powerfull tool to colorize and adjust images, support masking and gradient blending at runtime <br>

## Custom Effect

There is an example of simple grayscale effect that can be found in `Project Samples`

![_cover](https://github.com/NullTale/VolFx/assets/1497430/9670cfd8-563e-4283-bb9f-b4c221242bd1)

All effect must be inherated from `VolFx.Pass` and then added to a `VolFxRenderFeature` <br>
Material creates automatically using `ShaderName` attribute, `VolumeSettings` implemented using [Unity API](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.core@7.1/api/UnityEngine.Rendering.VolumeComponent.html)

```C#
[ShaderName("Hidden/VolFx/Grayscale")] // shader name for pass material
public class GrayscalePass : VolFx.Pass
{
    // =======================================================================
    public override bool Validate(Material mat)
    {
        // use stack from feature settings, feature use custom VolumeStack with its own LayerMask
        var settings = Stack.GetComponent<GrayscaleVol>();
        
        // return false if we don't want to execute pass, standart check
        if (settings.IsActive() == false)
            return false;
        
        // setup material before drawing
        mat.SetFloat("_Weight", settings.m_Weight.value);
        return true;
    }
}
```
Grayscale shader
```C#
Shader "Hidden/VolFx/Grayscale" // name of the shader for ShaderNameAttribute
...

half luma(half3 rgb)
{
    return dot(rgb, half3(0.299, 0.587, 0.114));
}

frag_in vert(const vert_in v)
{
    frag_in o;
    o.vertex = v.vertex;
    o.uv = v.uv;
    return o;
}

half4 frag(const frag_in i) : SV_Target
{
    half4 main = tex2D(_MainTex, i.uv);
    half4 col  = luma(main.rgb);
    
    return half4(lerp(main.rgb, luma(col.rgb), _Weight), main.a);
}
```
Feature work as a wrapper but can be extended by override low level methods, to gain access to a CommandBuffer and other rendering API stuff<br>
```C#
/// called to perform rendering
public virtual void Invoke(CommandBuffer cmd, RTHandle source, RTHandle dest,
                           ScriptableRenderContext context, ref RenderingData renderingData)
{
    Utils.Blit(cmd, source, dest, _material, 0, Invert);
}
```

## PostArt

More effects can be [downloaded](https://github.com/NullTale/PixelationFx) separately for use in combination<br>
If `VolFx` is installed they will work as part of the framework and will not appear in the RenderFeature list
  
Effects applied sequentially to a 3D object
